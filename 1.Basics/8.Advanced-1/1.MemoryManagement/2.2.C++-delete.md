# delete 操作符

与在 C 中使用 malloc 一样, 动态分配内存要注意随时释放不需要的内存。 C++ 中 delete 操作符与 new 配套使用
>语法
```c++
delete pointer; // 对应 new
// 或
delete[]pointer; // 对应 new[]
```
- 第1种表达形式用来删除给单个元素分配的内存
- 第2种表达形式用来删除多元素（数组）的内存分配
- 请严格遵守

>Example 
```c++
#include <stdio.h>

struct Camera{
    double focal;
    double fx;
    double fy;
    double cx;
    double cy;
};

int main()
{
    int* pInt = new int;
    if(pInt) printf("new an array: int[5].\n");
    else printf("new failed.\n");


    Camera* pCam = new Camera[5];
    if(pCam) printf("new an array: Camera[5].\n");
    else printf("new failed.\n");

    delete pInt;
    delete[] pCam;

    return 0;
}
```


>Why It Matters
- The difference between delete and delete[] becomes significant when dealing with classes that have custom destructors. If you allocate an array of objects using new[], you must use delete[] to properly call the destructor for `each object` in the array. Using delete instead of delete[] on an array of objects leads to undefined behavior, as only the destructor for the first object in the array will be called.

- Similarly, if you allocate a single object with new and then mistakenly use delete[], this could also result in undefined behavior.
