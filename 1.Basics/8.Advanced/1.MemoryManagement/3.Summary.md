# Summary

## malloc
>Advantages
- Simplicity: malloc provides a straightforward way to allocate raw memory.
- Portability: Being a standard C function, malloc is available in any environment that supports C.
- Compatibility with C libraries: When working with C libraries in C++, you may need to use malloc and free to ensure compatibility.

>Disadvantages
- No Constructors: malloc doesn't call constructors for objects, which means it's not suitable for allocating memory for `C++ classes` that require initialization.
- Type Safety: malloc returns a void pointer, so you need to cast it to the correct type. This can lead to errors if the wrong type is used.
- Manual Size Calculation: You have to manually calculate the size of the memory to allocate, which can lead to errors or inefficiencies.
- No Overloading: You can't overload malloc for custom allocation behavior in C++.

## new
>Advantages
- Type Safety: new returns a pointer of the correct type, which enhances type safety.
- Constructors: In C++, new calls the constructor for the allocated object, ensuring proper initialization.
- Operator Overloading: In C++, you can overload the new operator to provide custom behavior for memory allocation.
- Exception Handling: new throws an exception if the memory allocation fails, allowing for more robust error handling in C++.

>Disadvantages
- Complexity: new might be considered more complex, especially if you need to deal with custom overloads and behaviors.
- Performance: In some cases, new may be slower than malloc due to additional overhead like constructor calls (though this is generally minimal).
- C Compatibility: new is specific to C++, so it's not suitable for C code or mixed C/C++ code where C linkage is needed.

## Summary
Use `malloc` in C or when you need to interface with C libraries in C++.

Use `new` in C++ when you want type safety, automatic constructor calls, or the ability to customize allocation behavior.

Remember that in C++, you must pair new with delete and malloc with free. Mixing them (e.g., using new with free or malloc with delete) can lead to undefined behavior.
