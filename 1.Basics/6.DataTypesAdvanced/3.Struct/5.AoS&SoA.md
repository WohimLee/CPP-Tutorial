# AoS & SoA
AoS (Array of Structures) and SoA (Structure of Arrays) are two common ways to organize data in memory, particularly in graphics, simulations, and parallel computing.


&emsp;
## AoS (Array of Structures)
- In this layout, an array is created where each element of the array is a structure containing multiple fields. This means that all the information for a single object is stored together in memory.

>Example
```c++
#include <iostream>

struct Point {
    float x, y, z;
};

int main() {
    // Define an array of Point structures
    Point pointsAoS[3] = {
        {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f},
        {4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f},
        {7.0f, 8.0f, 9.0f}
    };

    // Access elements in AoS
    std::cout << "AoS x[1]: " << pointsAoS[1].x << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}

```



&emsp;
## SoA (Structure of Arrays)
- In this layout, instead of storing each object's fields together, you store all the data for each field together.

>Example
```c++
#include <iostream>

struct Points {
    float x[3], y[3], z[3];
};

int main() {
    // Define a single structure containing three arrays
    Points pointsSoA = {
        {1.0f, 4.0f, 7.0f}, // x values
        {2.0f, 5.0f, 8.0f}, // y values
        {3.0f, 6.0f, 9.0f}  // z values
    };

    // Access elements in SoA
    std::cout << "SoA x[1]: " << pointsSoA.x[1] << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Comparison
### AoS
>Advantages
- AoS is generally more intuitive and can be more cache-efficient if you often access all the fields of an object at the same time.

>Disadvantages
- However, it can be inefficient if you only need to access a subset of the fields for many objects at once, as you would end up loading unnecessary data into cache.

### SoA
>Advantages
- SoA can be more efficient if you need to process many objects but only need a subset of the fields at a time. By grouping the same fields together, it allows for better vectorization and parallelization in certain computations. 

>Disadvantages
- However, it can be more complex to manage and may be less efficient if you often need to access all the fields of individual objects.
