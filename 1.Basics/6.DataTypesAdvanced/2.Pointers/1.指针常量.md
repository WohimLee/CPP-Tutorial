# 指针常量和常量指针
Read it backwards (as driven by Clockwise/Spiral Rule):

- `int* (ptr)` - pointer to int
- `int const * (ptr)` - pointer to const int
- `int * const (ptr)` - const pointer to int
- `int const * const (ptr)` - const pointer to const int

Now the first `const` can be on either side of the type so:

- `const int * (ptr)` == `int const * (ptr)`
- `const int * const (ptr)` == `int const * const (ptr)`

If you want to go really crazy you can do things like this:

- `int * (ptr) * (ptr)` - pointer to (pointer to int)
- `int * (ptr) * const (ptr)` - a const pointer to (a pointer to an int)
- `int * const (ptr) * (ptr)` - a pointer to (a const pointer to an int)
- `int const * (ptr) * (ptr)` - a pointer to (a pointer to a const int)
- `int * const * (ptr) const (ptr)` - a const pointer to (a const pointer to an int)
- ...


And to make sure we are clear on the meaning of `const`:

>示例
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;

    // ============ type* ptr ============
    int* ptr1 = &a;
    ptr1 = &b;   // value of pointer 可以改
    *ptr1 = 111; // value pointed by 可以改

    // ============ type const* ptr ============
    const int* ptr2 = &a;
    ptr2 = &b;      // value of pointer 可以改
    // *ptr2 = 222; // value pointed by 不可以改

    // ============ type * const ptr ============
    int* const ptr3 = &a;
    // ptr3 = &c;  // value of pointer 不可以改
    *ptr3 = 333;   // value pointed by 可以改

    // ============ type const * const ptr ============
    int const * const ptr4 = &a;
    // ptr3 = &c;   // value of pointer 不可以改
    // *ptr4 = 444; // value pointed by 不可以改

    cout << ptr1 << endl;
    cout << *ptr1 << endl;
    return 0;
}        
```


`foo` is a variable pointer to a constant integer. This lets you change what you point to but not the value that you point to. Most often this is seen with C-style strings where you have a pointer to a `const char`. You may change which string you point to but you can't change the content of these strings. This is important when the string itself is in the data segment of a program and shouldn't be changed.

`bar` is a constant or fixed pointer to a value that can be changed. This is like a reference without the extra syntactic sugar. Because of this fact, usually you would use a reference where you would use a `T* const` pointer unless you need to allow NULL pointers.
